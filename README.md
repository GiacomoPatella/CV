I'm a junior web developer and label manager of independent record label Five Fold Records.  
After doing a web design course as a teenager in 1998 (back in the Notepad days), I took a different route into the music industry but never lost my fascination for coding. I attended Makers Academy to acquire long-desired programming skills and I was thought by some of the best programmers around such as Evgeny Shadchnev, Enrique Comba Ripenhausen, Alex Peattie and Stephen Lloyd.  
I'm now open to job opportunities in front end development and web design.

## PROJECTS

##### TWITTER TIMELINE
To practice our CSS skills I made a replica of Twitter's timeline down to the pixel.
I had some initial difficulties in positioning and layering divs on top of each other but in the end it all worked well.
I used Bootstrap 3 and Twitter's own stripes to create the navbar but everything else on the page is my own CSS. This page could be improved with jQuery to simulate the infinte scrolling of the timeline. [GITHUB](https://github.com/GiacomoPatella/twitter_timeline).

##### MAKERS APP UI DESIGN
During the Christmas break I took a couple of days off coding to try out Sketch 2, a professional vector-based grpahic editor. To practice I decided to mock-up a UI design for a possible mobile app for Makers Academy.
All icons, menus and shapes (apart from the iphone casing) are designed by me. 
All copy is from Makers Academy's offical website. [DESIGN ON GITHUB](https://github.com/GiacomoPatella/makers_app)

##### SUDOKU
My first web app using Sinatra - a DSL for web services.
Evgeny Shadchev (@shadchnev) provided me with instruction on how to set up Sinatra and the skeleton of this web app.
This web app could be improved by more integration tests and a more sophisticated puzzle generator that would check if there is only one solution to a new puzzle.

##### CROWDDED
As one of the 5 members of the team for our final project at Makers Academy I was in charge of mocking up the website pages in Photoshop for our crowd-funding website. After reviewing the designs with the rest of the team, I proceeded to code the pages in HTML, CSS3, jQuery, Javascript on top of the ZURB Foundation framework. We had some issues deploying to Heroku so unfortunately at the moment I can only provide you with screenshots of my work. [GITHUB](https://github.com/GiacomoPatella/crowdded_design)

##### RUBY FUNDAMENTALS
This was a basic question & answer test to brush up on our Ruby skills during the last few days at Makers Academy. The aim was to pass the test and using semantic and neat code.
All my answers are on Github. [GITHUB](https://github.com/GiacomoPatella/ruby-fundamentals)
